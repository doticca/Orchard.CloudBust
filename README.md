# CloudBust

CloudBust is an Orchard fork that acts like a Backend as a Service. Extends Orchard CMS with an application developer platform that lets developers build web applications that act as a backend in minutes. Main difference with other BaaS platforms is that your Backend will also act as your web frontend server while you launche a full featured mobile application. In your mobile application you can use CloudBust mobile SDK to access your server data, manage logins, store online content, secure your assets and create business logic with the builtin SenseAPI framework.
