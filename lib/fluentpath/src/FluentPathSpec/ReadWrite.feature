Feature: Read and write files
	In order to read and write files in various encodings
	As a developer
	I want to use a fluent API

Scenario: Write to a text file with default encoding
	Given a clean test directory
	When I create a bar\dejavu.txt text file with the text "Déjà Vu"
	Then the binary content of bar\dejavu.txt should be 44c3a96ac3a0205675

Scenario: Write to a text file with UTF-16 encoding
	Given a clean test directory
	When I create a UTF-16 encoded bar\dejavu.txt file with the text "Déjà Vu"
	Then the binary content of bar\dejavu.txt should be fffe4400e9006a00e000200056007500

Scenario: Write to a binary file
	Given a clean test directory
	When I create a bar\binary.bin binary file with 010045f974123456
	Then the binary content of bar\binary.bin should be 010045f974123456

Scenario: Read a text file
	Given a clean test directory
	Then the text content of bar\baz.txt should be "bar baz"
	
Scenario: Read a binary file
	Given a clean test directory
	Then the binary content of sub\binary.bin should be 000102030405ff

Scenario: Open a text file
	Given a clean test directory
	When I open bar\baz.txt
	Then the resulting string should be "bar baz"

Scenario: Open files
	Given a clean test directory
	When I open bar\baz.txt, sub\baz.txt and read the contents
	Then the resulting string should be "bar bazsub baz" 
	
Scenario: Open files with path
	Given a clean test directory
	When I open bar\baz.txt, sub\baz.txt and read the path and contents
	Then the resulting string should be "bar\baz.txt:bar bazsub\baz.txt:sub baz"

Scenario: Read files
	Given a clean test directory
	When I read the contents of bar\baz.txt, sub\baz.txt
	Then the resulting string should be "bar bazsub baz"
	
Scenario: Read files with path
	Given a clean test directory
	When I read the path and contents of bar\baz.txt, sub\baz.txt
	Then the resulting string should be "bar\baz.txt:bar bazsub\baz.txt:sub baz"
	
Scenario: Append text to a file
	Given a clean test directory
	When I append " - this was appended" to \bar\baz.txt
	Then the text content of bar\baz.txt should be "bar baz - this was appended"

Scenario: Writing then reading a file with UTF-16 encoding
	Given a clean test directory
	When I create a UTF-16 encoded bar\dejavu.txt file with the text "Déjà Vu"
	Then the text content of bar\dejavu.txt as read using UTF-16 encoding should be "Déjà Vu"

Scenario: Writing to a file with encoding UTF-16 replaces the contents
	Given a clean test directory
	When I write "Déjà Vu" to bar\baz.txt using UTF-16 encoding
	Then the text content of bar\baz.txt as read using UTF-16 encoding should be "Déjà Vu"

Scenario: Binary writing to a file
	Given a clean test directory
	When I write bytes 44c3a96ac3a0205675 to bar\baz.txt
	Then the text content of bar\baz.txt should be "Déjà Vu"

Scenario: Appending to a file with encoding UTF-16 appends new contents
	Given a clean test directory
	When I create a UTF-16 encoded bar\dejavu.txt file with the text "Déjà Vu"
	And I append " Déjà Vu" to bar\dejavu.txt using UTF-16 encoding
	Then the text content of bar\dejavu.txt as read using UTF-16 encoding should be "Déjà Vu Déjà Vu"

#Scenario: Encrypting and decrypting a file
#	Given a clean test directory
#	When I encrypt bar\baz.txt
#	And I copy bar\baz.txt to bar\encrypted.txt
#	And I decrypt bar\baz.txt
#	Then the text content of bar\baz.txt should be "bar baz"
#	And the text content of bar\encrypted.txt should be "bar baz"
#    And bar\baz.txt should not be encrypted
#	And bar\encrypted.txt should be encrypted

Scenario: Setting attributes
	Given a clean test directory
	When I set attributes Temporary, Hidden on bar\baz.txt
	Then attributes Temporary, Hidden should be set on bar\baz.txt

Scenario: Setting creation time
	Given a clean test directory
	When I set creation time on bar\baz.txt to 5/21/1970
	And I set creation time on bar\bar to 5/21/1970
	Then the creation time on bar\baz.txt is 5/21/1970
	And the creation time on bar\bar is 5/21/1970
	
Scenario: Setting UTC creation time
	Given a clean test directory
	When I set UTC creation time on bar\baz.txt to 5/21/1970
	And I set UTC creation time on bar\bar to 5/21/1970
	Then the UTC creation time on bar\baz.txt is 5/21/1970
	And the UTC creation time on bar\bar is 5/21/1970
	
Scenario: Setting last access time
	Given a clean test directory
	When I set last access time on bar\baz.txt to 5/21/1970
	And I set last access time on bar\bar to 5/21/1970
	Then the last access time on bar\baz.txt is 5/21/1970
	And the last access time on bar\bar is 5/21/1970
	
Scenario: Setting UTC last access time
	Given a clean test directory
	When I set UTC last access time on bar\baz.txt to 5/21/1970
	And I set UTC last access time on bar\bar to 5/21/1970
	Then the UTC last access time on bar\baz.txt is 5/21/1970
	And the UTC last access time on bar\bar is 5/21/1970
	
Scenario: Setting last write time
	Given a clean test directory
	When I set last write time on bar\baz.txt to 5/21/1970
	And I set last write time on bar\bar to 5/21/1970
	Then the last write time on bar\baz.txt is 5/21/1970
	And the last write time on bar\bar is 5/21/1970
	
Scenario: Setting UTC last write time
	Given a clean test directory
	When I set UTC last write time on bar\baz.txt to 5/21/1970
	And I set UTC last write time on bar\bar to 5/21/1970
	Then the UTC last write time on bar\baz.txt is 5/21/1970
	And the UTC last write time on bar\bar is 5/21/1970
