# Parallel Extensions Extras Documentation



Parallel Extensions Extras is a library written by the developers of .NET TPL, consisting of a vast number of extensions and other classes, all dealing with task parallelism. You can independently download the library together with many examples [from MSDN](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ParExtSamples), as well as read a [series of blog posts](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2010/04/04/9990342.aspx) dedicated to Parallel Extensions Extras.  
**Note that although Parallel Extensions Extras is not a feature in Orchard sense, they only get compiled if a feature of the module is enabled.** Therefore if you use any of the classes from it, take a dependency on Piedone.HelpfulLibraries.
